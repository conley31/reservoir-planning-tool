Week 1 (Summary)
2/12	2h	Helped set up repository, added Google Map with JSON overlay
2/13	2h 	Added geolocation on the map using the JS web API
2/15	2h	Worked on styling of the website and making the map fit
2/19	4h	Worked on selection of the map, so it highlights the correct area that was clicked
		Restrict the zoom level of the map to remedy slow rendering
Week 2 (Plan)
2/20	3h	Write a method to find map features by lat/long
2/21	3h	Add Google Geolocation api for searching locations by address
2/23

Name: Jonah Heeren

Week 1 (Summary)
2/15	1hr	Got MySQL setup on my laptop and added initial setup.
2/16	4hr	Learning node and experimenting with parsing nested CSVs. The result of which was realizing that node was not the appropriate solution for DB setup due to its asynchronous nature. It tried to open 12000 CSVs at the same time which caused heap overflows.
2/17	2hr	Fixed data files to make them CSVs that had a common delimiter. Note: Not in git because this is 3GBs of text files.
2/17	2hr	Experimenting with whether bash would be a faster option to build the database. Since every SQL statement required auth, it seemed slower and less efficient than using the python libs.
2/17	3hr	Wrote the database setup script in python

Week 2 (Plan)
2/19	5hr	Writing the update script for the DB.
2/22	2hr	Provide interface for querying partial daily data.
2/23	1hr	Continue working on interface for querying partial daily data.

Week 1 (Summary)
2/13	3hr	Went through Google Charts documentation and quick guide
2/14	4hr	Setup basic layout for the website
2/17	1hr	Setup example google chart as placeholder
2/18	2hr	Created calculator form inputs
Week 2 (Plan)
2/20	4hr	Setup graph to accept calculated inputs
2/24	2hr	Add mock data to graphs
2/25	4hr	Prepare calculated region data for graphing

=== Weekly Team Report (Team 16: Reservoir Planning Tool) ===
Week 1 (Summary) (Scrum master: Drew Atkinson)
Overall Progress Summary: This week we have worked on building the core components of the project. The basic layout of the website has been setup. The database has been initialized with data from our project owners. We have laid out the mapping service on the front-end and added an overlay with possible locations and added the ability to select a location. The graphs are ready to be put into the website. Lastly, the backend routing was taken care of and the algorithm that all of our data will flow through has been written.
2/12	1.5 hrs   Finished Sprint 1 Planning Document and Discuss weekly goals
2/14	2hrs  Met with project owners and discuss what will be done during sprint 1.
         (Got updates on project specifics regarding design of algorithm and inputs
           from user)
2/17	1hr  Discussed what each member had done on their assignments and what was left
 to be done. Began planning for upcoming week as well.

Week 2 (Plan) (Scrum master: Drew Atkinson)
[Meetings]
2/20	Meet to discuss database schema
2/21 	(Clayton) Meet with project owner to discuss algorithm
2/24	Weekly Scrum meeting
[Individual Goals]
